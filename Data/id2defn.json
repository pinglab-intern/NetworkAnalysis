This list represents a union set of harmonized traditional medicine conditions of the Chinese, Japanese, and Korean classifications.  For an extended list of traditional medicine conditions, please refer to the International Classification of Traditional Medicine (ICTM). \n\n\n**Definitions:** \n\nA disorder in traditional medicine, disorder (TM1)[1], refers to a set of dysfunctions in any of the body systems which presents with associated manifestations, i.e. a single or a group of specified signs, symptoms, or findings. Each disorder (TM1) may be defined by its symptomatology, etiology, course and outcome, or treatment response. \n\n1. Symptomatology: signs, symptoms or unique findings by traditional medicine diagnostic methods, including inspection such as tongue examination, history taking (inquiry), listening and smelling examination, palpation such as pulse taking, abdominal examination, and other methods. \n\n2. TM Etiology: the underlying traditional medicine explanatory style, such as environmental factors (historically known in TM translations as the external contractions), emotional factors (historically known in TM translations as the seven emotions), or other pathological factors, processes, and products. \n\n3. Course and outcome: a unique path of development of the disorder (TM1) over time. 4 Treatment response: known response to traditional medicine interventions. In defining a disorder (TM1), symptomology and etiology are required. Course and outcome, and treatment response are optional. \n\nA pattern in traditional medicine, pattern (TM1), refers to the complete clinical presentation of the patient at a given moment in time including all findings. Findings may include symptomology or patient constitution, among other things. \n\n1. Symptomatology (as above). \n2. Constitution: the characteristics of an individual, including structural and functional characteristics, temperament, ability to adapt to environmental changes, or susceptibility to various health conditions. This is relatively stable, being in part genetically determined while partially acquired.\n\n\n\n[1]:'TM1' refers to Traditional Medicine conditions - Module I.

Atresia refers to a congenital obstruction with complete occlusion of the intestinal lumen. It accounts for 95% of obstructions. Four types of jejunoileal atresias are described. They can range from having a small area of blockage or web to missing large sections of the intestines.\nIntestinal atresia is one of the most frequent causes of bowel obstruction in the newborn. The ileal atresia is more common than jejunal atresia, and multiple foci are more common than isolated atresia. The most accepted theory regarding the etiology of jejunoileal atresia is that of an intrauterine vascular accident resulting in necrosis of the affected segment.\nStenosis, on the other hand, refers to a partial occlusion with incomplete obstruction and accounts for the remaining 5% of cases. A stenosis has an intact mesentery and is a localized narrowing of the bowel.

However, for most analytical purposes and for identifying intervention opportunities, it is especially useful to categorize injuries according to whether or not they were deliberately inflicted and by whom. Commonly used categories are:\n\n- unintentional (i.e. accidental)\n- intentional (i.e. deliberate):\n- interpersonal (e.g. assault and homicide)\n- self-harm (e.g. abuse of drugs and alcohol, self-mutilation, suicide)\n- legal intervention (e.g. action by police or other law enforcement personnel)\n- war, civil insurrection and disturbances (e.g. demonstrations and riots)\n- undetermined intent\n\nRegarding the collection of events that cause injuries, a set of definitions apply.
